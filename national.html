            ECI Introduces Stricter Voter Documentation Rules Amid National Roll Revision
          </h1>
          <p>
            Kolkata, August 11, 2025: The Election Commission of India (ECI) has implemented new, more stern rules for verifying documents as part of its ongoing nationwide revision of electoral rolls. The changes, introduced under the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) program, aim to clean up voter lists but have sparked concerns over potential exclusion and political bias.
            <br><br>
            To standardize and tighten verification, the ECI has rolled out a five-tier documentation system in states such as Rajasthan. Voters are now categorized from Grade A to E based on the availability and authenticity of their documents.
            <br><br>
            Grade A voters, mostly those on the 2002 rolls, are automatically verified. Grades B to E require increasing levels of documentation and scrutiny, particularly for new voters or those with recent address changes. Officials say the system is designed to ensure genuine entries and remove duplication or ineligible voters.
            <br><br>
            Responding to growing public and legal criticism, the ECI recently assured the Supreme Court that no voter will be removed from the list without following due process. This includes prior written notice, a formal objection window, and a hearing before deletion.
            <br><br>
            The clarification came after opposition leaders raised concerns about nearly 65 lakh voter names being dropped during the draft roll revision in Bihar. The ECI, however, stated that it is not legally required to publish the names of those excluded, triggering further outrage.
            <br><br>
            Leaders from multiple opposition parties have accused the ECI of political bias. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi criticized the timing of the revision—just months before key elections—and questioned why documents like Aadhaar and existing EPICs are being rejected for verification.
            <br><br>
            In Tripura, former Chief Minister Manik Sarkar accused the BJP of manipulating the voter rolls to tilt the political balance. He warned of national-level protests if the revision process continues in what he called an "undemocratic and exclusionary" manner.
            <br><br>
            While the Commission maintains that the reforms are aimed at improving electoral integrity, critics fear that the stricter documentation requirements could disproportionately affect marginalized communities, migrants, and rural voters, who may lack the required paperwork.
            <br><br>
            Election officials, however, argue that the system is designed with built-in flexibility and legal safeguards to avoid wrongful exclusions.
            <br><br>
            The nationwide roll revision and documentation process is expected to continue until the end of the year, ahead of major state elections and the 2026 Lok Sabha polls. Voters are advised to check their status, respond to notices promptly, and ensure all documentation is updated.
            <br><br>
            The ECI’s latest voter documentation reforms mark a decisive push toward more accurate electoral roll. But with elections approaching, the balance between transparency, security, and inclusion remains under intense political and legal scrutiny.
