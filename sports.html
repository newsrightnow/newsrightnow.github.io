          <h1 class='l-heading'>India Clinches Historic 7-Run Win Over England in Oval Thriller</h1>
          <p>Kolkata, August 11, 2025: In one of the most dramatic finishes in recent Test history, India defeated England by just 7 runs in the final Test at The Oval, levelling the five-match series 2-2. The victory marks India's narrowest-ever Test win and has already been hailed as an instant classic by cricketing legends and fans alike.

England, chasing 210 runs on a tricky Day 5 pitch, seemed in control with solid partnerships through the middle order. But a brilliant spell by pacer Mohammed Siraj, who picked up five wickets, turned the game on its head in the final session. The hosts collapsed from 170/5 to 202 all out, handing India a famous win.

With regular captain Rohit Sharma out due to injury, Shubman Gill took charge of the team and led with maturity and composure. This series marked Gill’s first as Test captain, and his calm leadership was widely praised. Young players like Yashasvi Jaiswal and Dhruv Jurel played vital supporting roles throughout the series.

Speaking after the match, Gill said, “This win isn’t just about the scoreboard—it’s about belief. We never gave up, and we stayed in the fight until the very end.”

Former Indian captain Sachin Tendulkar praised the team’s performance, calling them “supermen of Indian cricket.” Social media exploded with praise for Siraj’s fiery spell and Gill’s strategic field placements in the final hour.

The series was filled with standout performances, including centuries from England’s Joe Root and Harry Brook, but it was India's resilience that defined the finale.

The win not only restores India's pride after early series losses but also sets the tone for upcoming home Tests. It also strengthens Shubman Gill’s position as a potential long-term leader in red-ball cricket.</p>
