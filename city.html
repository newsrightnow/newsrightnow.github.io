          <p>Potholes, Cracks, and Delays: Kolkata’s Roads in Dire Need of Repair

Kolkata, 11 August, 2025: As the monsoon rains continue to batter the city, the deteriorating condition of Kolkata’s roads has become a major concern for commuters and residents. From South Kolkata’s Garia to North Kolkata’s Shyambazar, several stretches are riddled with potholes, open manholes, and uneven surfaces, raising serious questions about civic maintenance and road safety.

Roads that were recently repaired are already showing signs of damage. Major traffic routes such as EM Bypass, Jessore Road, and AJC Bose Road are filled with potholes, leading to massive traffic congestion and frequent accidents.

Public transport operators are also facing the heat. Bus drivers complain of vehicle damage and delays, especially during peak hours.

The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has admitted to delays in road repair work, citing continuous rainfall and tender-related issues as key obstacles. A senior civic official stated, “We are aware of the problem. Emergency patchwork is underway, but permanent repairs will be done post-monsoon.”

However, locals say temporary patchwork doesn't last, and repeated excuses have become the norm.

Opposition parties have accused the ruling Trinamool Congress of poor planning and budget mismanagement. BJP leader Sajal Ghosh said, “Every year we see the same situation. Where is the taxpayers' money going? The roads break down just weeks after repair.”

Meanwhile, Left party members have demanded a public audit of civic repair contracts and quality checks by independent agencies.

Urban planners argue that Kolkata needs a comprehensive road maintenance policy and stricter quality control during construction. “Many roads are built with low-grade materials and poor drainage planning. Unless that changes, this cycle will repeat every year,” said Prof. Ananya Roy, a transport researcher at Jadavpur University.

With the festive season approaching and the monsoon showing no signs of retreat, Kolkata’s crumbling roads pose a serious risk to safety and mobility. Unless long-term solutions replace short-term fixes, citizens will continue to pay the price for poor urban governance.</p>
